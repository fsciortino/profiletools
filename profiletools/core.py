    Parameters
    ----------
    X_dim : positive int, optional
        Number of dimensions of the independent variable. Default value is 1.
    X_units : str, list of str or None, optional
        Units for each of the independent variables. If `X_dim`=1, this should
        given as a single string, if `X_dim`>1, this should be given as a list
        of strings of length `X_dim`. Default value is `None`, meaning a list
        of empty strings will be used.
    y_units : str, optional
        Units for the dependent variable. Default is an empty string.
