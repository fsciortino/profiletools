profiletools: Classes for working with profile data of arbitrary dimension
==========================================================================

Source home: https://github.com/markchil/profiletools

Overview
--------

:py:mod:`profiletools` is a Python package that provides a convenient, powerful and extensible way of working with multivariate data, particularly profile data from magnetic plasma confinement devices. :py:mod:`profiletools` features deep integration with :py:mod:`gptools` to support Gaussian process regression (GPR). Refer to https://github.com/markchil/gptools for more information.

Notes
-----

:py:mod:`profiletools` has been developed and tested on Python 2.7 and scipy 0.14.0. It may work just as well on other versions, but has not been tested.

`profiletools` uses the module `gptools` for GPR. You can find the source at https://github.com/markchil/gptools/ and the documentation at http://gptools.readthedocs.org/

`profiletools` uses the module `eqtools` for tokamak coordinate transformations. You can find the source at https://github.com/PSFCPlasmaTools/eqtools/ and the documentation at http://eqtools.readthedocs.org/

Once I put together a formal publication on this software and its applications, this readme will be updated with the relevant citation.
